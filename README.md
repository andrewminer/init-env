This repository contains the basic setup for how I like to configure my command line.  It contains my shell setup,
editor settings, and other odds and ends.  In order to get a new machine up and running, simply clone this repository
onto the machine and run the included `install.sh` script.  It will check for missing software and install it, and it
will install its own versions of various important configuration files (e.g., `.profile`, `.vimrc`, etc.).
